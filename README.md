# 👋🏼 Oh, hi there!

  Welcome to my GitHub profile! 😄 
  
  My name is Lorenzo (he/him). I'm a Software Engineer Student @ 42 Heilbronn. 
  I enjoy competing in Hackathons and other Software Development competitions.
  Currently, I'm learning how to write Smart Contracts using Solidity. I'm also exploring the possibilities and limitations of GPT-3 and DALL-E to create aesthetic artwork.
